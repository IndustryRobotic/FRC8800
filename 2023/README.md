# 2023 Season ‚ñ∫ Charged Up!
The `main.java` file contains the robot code that our team came up with for the 2023 season. There's a likelyhood that the version we provided in here has small differences with the one that was
uploaded to the robot during the competition. This is likely due to a couple of adjustments, calibrations or last second changes. However, we believe this version should be enough for people to have
a brief understanding of what is going on. We have tried a couple of experimental features to test how well they would perform during the actual competition. One of the ideas was *turning the Limelight into a driver camera
when needed*. It might sound a bit silly at first, but trust us, the more we thought about it, the sillier it became! üòÅ. Regardless of the outcome, we're always excited to explore new ideas!

**Charged Up!** was the first season that we tried working with real-time vision processing. We mainly worked with Apriltags. As you can see in the file, we still have pieces of pure test code in the
`autonomousPeriodic()` function! Luckily, the test code was removed before the competition. And we have replaced it with a better version that we currently can't get our hands on. As mentioned before,
we *sadly* can not reach the true final version of the code.

Despite some challenges we've encountered, both code-wise and robot-wise, It has been a really fun season for us.

**Thanks for reading!**
